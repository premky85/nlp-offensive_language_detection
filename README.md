# Offensive language detection

## Getting started
This repository contains different approaches to English-Slovenian Offensive language detection. You can find different models in `/models` folder.

### Requirements


### Usage

#### Deep neural networks 
Example of DNN model usage can be foud in `predict.ipynb`. Trained models can be obtained [HERE](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xRx20enFwD3mVe8LvX2c8v5M37jvo0X5?usp=sharing). Password can be obtained by contacting me on email: <lp8783@student.uni-lj.si>.

There are 3 different architectures:
- mBERT
- XLMr
- CroSloEngualBERT

Each trained on three different datasets:
- Slovenian + English
- Slovenian
- English
